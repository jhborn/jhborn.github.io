                Peach cobler has to be one of if not the best thanksgiving desert.
                with a pie crust and full of flavor cut open into it and the peaches just come rushing out.
                fresh sliceed peaches warm and fresh out of the oven with a cold scoop of ice cream mealting onto the pie. not only do you get a pie you get ice cream with it.
